# Data Visulaization: Ford GoBike Trip Data

## Dataset

> In this project I performed exploratory & explanatory data analysises on Ford GoBike trip data from 2019.<br>
The dataset contains ride information about people using Ford GoBike. These information include the time when the ride has started and ended, places (including longtitude & latitude) where the ride has started and ended, the duration of the ride, etc... In addition to that, there are some information about the users like their gender, birth year, and their type (whether they are subscribers or customers).<br>
The dataset consists of 183412 rows and 16 columns.

## Summary of Findings

> The mean average for trip durations is 10 minutes.<br>
The distribution for the start hour of trips is bimodal with two peaks.<br>
Most of the trips take place during weekdays.<br>
There are more subscribers than customers in the dataset.<br>
The distribution for the users'ages is right-skewed.<br>
There are more male users than female users.<br>
Trip durations on weekdays last longer than weekends.<br>
Subscribers' trips last longer than customer's trips.<br>
Users, who are 20 years old, ride much longer than the rest of group ages.<br>
There is no significat difference in trip durations between males and females.<br>

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I have observed that customers use GoBike for longer durations on weekends which makes sense if they use it for wandering around the city. Generally, subscribers use GoBike for shorter durations.<br>
We have also found that the peaks for using GoBike are at 8:00 o'clock in the morning and 17:00 o'clock in the evening and that subscribers use GoBike more on weekdays. This might indicate that they use GoBike as a transportation to/from school/college/work.
